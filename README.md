# MyAngularStore
An simple store made with Angular, developed with Typescript and Bootstrap.

## Setup and running app:

1. Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed on your machine, if not, just run `npm install -g @angular/cli` on the project directory.

2. Open your code editor and terminal, and clone this project.

3. Run npm i and npm i --save-dev to install all the dependencies since node_modules is not included in the repo.

4. Run `ng serve --port=3000` to start the app on 0.0.0.0:3000. This will run the app on the ip address 0.0.0.0 and on port 3000.
